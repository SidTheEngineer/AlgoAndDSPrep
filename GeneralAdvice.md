# During the interview

Below will be a general formula that I tend to follow during technical interviews that has been tried and tested by many and may allow you to put your best foot forward while tackling problems.

**Disclaimer**: I take no responsibility for your interview performance. In fact, I can't even claim to be a very good technical interviewee; This is simply a way of organizing my own thoughts and improve on the approach I like to take.

# Step 1: Receiving the question

Let's be honest here, at this step you're going to receive the problem from your interviewer and either immediately get a flash of insight due to solving something similar/noticing the underlying pattern, or you're going to have an "oh shit" thought go through your head. If you can't recognize the type of problem you're given soon after, do not fret, you'll have time to wrestle through it.

### Action: Ask clarifying questions

Wtf is a clarifying question you might ask? Here are some examples:

_"Can I assume that the input list will only contain positive integers?"_

_"What kind of space complexity constraints am I working with?"_

... etc. Any questions that can help you better wrap your mind around the problem should be asked (including edge cases like empty/null inputs, etc).

# Step 2: Developing an approach

At this point, you should have in mind what kind of data structures or patterns from your tool belt might be helpful for tackling the problem. For example:

_"Hmm ... if I have two pointers, starting at the start and end of the list working inward, I may be able to solve this in O(n) time"_

or

_"Maybe if I create an inorder list from my tree, I can ..."_

In the worst case, you should at least have some idea of a _very_ nonoptimal solution to at least get _some_ thoughts out there and improve on the solution later.

### Action: Express your initial thoughts and write notes

This is where we'll begin to start talking through our thought process on what kind of approach we might start taking towards the problem. In this stage, I like to begin writing my algorithm in bulleted/note fashion, stating what data structures I might use as well (essentially the English-sudocode version of your approach). 

**Tip**: Check in with your interviewer (especially if he or she is completely silent). Make sure they're following along with your thought process/approach. Here's my go-to line for doing this after expressing some thoughts:

_"Does that make sense?"_

The more your interviewer follows along with you, the easier time they're going to have guiding you in the right direction if you stray from a correct path.
